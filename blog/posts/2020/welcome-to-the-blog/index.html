        <p>The internet has made it more accessible than ever for folks to ask questions, share knowledge, and collaborate. And I've got to admit, without it, I wouldn't be where I am today doing the things I do. I figured it was due time I created a space to give back, even if it ends up with me just blabbering into the void ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<h2>A bit of history</h2>
<p>I designed and created this site about six years ago in 2014 (!), back when I was still a student and learning the ropes of software engineering. At the time, web development was really booming with some awesome tooling available built on <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> and <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> being all hip.. and I wanted in on that.</p>
<p>Instead of using a theme or a pre-built site, I stuck to a fairly simple design that primarily uses static HTML and CSS with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/">Bootstrap's grid system</a> and <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> for CSS preprocessing. I used Gulp as the task runner to watch files as I developed, trigger preprocessing, and compile the payload for hosting. Having a domain all ready to go, I published the site and hosted it through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's 2020. The world of web development has become even more diverse, and honestly, a bit overwhelming with all the options we have to getting yourself hosted on the net. I didn't want to complicate things just to have a space to write up a few words every now and then. So here we are; practically the same site with a blog <s>hacked together</s> nealty integrated on the side.</p>
<h2>Why not just use <em>insert hosted blogging solution here</em>?</h2>
<p>There's no doubt that I could be up and running in a couple of minutes to write on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, or just spin up a new Wordpress site (that's still a thing, right?), but I wanted something that could be integrated to my existing website and where I would own all my content and its publishing. I wasn't in the market for anything fancy‚Äî just need something that can be statically generated and hosted, and plays well with the existing technology stack being used, i.e., Node.js/JavaScript. Plus, I'd say the design and styling still looks fairly modern for today, so why change that?</p>
<p>That's where 11ty comes in.</p>
<h2>11ty</h2>
<p>While on my search for a blogging solution I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">staticgen.com</a>, a website that tracks popular static site generators on GitHub and highlights the respective languages and templating technologies used. Several options line the top of that list: <a href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">GatsbyJS</a>, and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, however, these relied on technologies that I was not yet familiar with like React or Go. A couple of entries down on that list is where I found <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> (pronounced <em>Eleventy</em>).</p>
<p>11ty is a static generator built with JavaScript and supports a wide variety of templating languages including Markdown. It is able to simply generate HTML into a folder of your liking, which was just what I was looking for. Here are some of the resources I used in addition to the generator's documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ianrose/deventy">https://github.com/ianrose/deventy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://keepinguptodate.com/pages/2019/06/creating-blog-with-eleventy/"> https://keepinguptodate.com/pages/2019/06/creating-blog-with-eleventy/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After a couple of weeks of relearning <em>how to web</em>, I was able to bring life back to the site, do a bit of refactoring, and set the blog up to publish my first post!</p>
<h2>This makes me a professional blogger now, right?</h2>
<p>Yeah, nah.</p>
<p>There's still a lot to improve under-the-hood, which I'll continue to work on over the next little while. For example, I'd like to modernize the development tooling being used (I really shouldn't need a Ruby dependency in 2020 to compile my CSS) and set up a blogging workflow that automates generation and publishing of posts. I think it'd be neat to have a <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces/">GitHub Codespace</a> set up where I can spin up my repo from any device, author a new post using a hosted VSCode instance, and have a <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Action</a> take over to generate and publish on commit.</p>
<p>Even once I've got that all sorted out, I'm not setting any specific expectations or post cadence for this blog. I hope to share my ideas, perspectives, and learnings as they come, when I think they can be of value to others or simply as a means to document them for future reference.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. <br>‚úåüèº</p>
