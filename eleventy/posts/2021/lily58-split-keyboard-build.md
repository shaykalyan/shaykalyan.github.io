A quick build log / reference post covering my first stab at a hardware project: building a split ergonomic keyboard based on the [Lily58 layout](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58), running QMK firmware. Being baited by several beautiful builds online, I had no choice but to dive into this world of mechanical keyboards with zero electronics experience under my belt. I relied on several online resources to learn what goes into building a keyboard, the basic equipment needed, and key firmware pieces necessary for it all to work that I aggregate here to serve as a reference for others planning to give it a shot!

# But why?
Before I dig into the how, I figured I shoud share a bit about the _why_ I went ahead and put together my own keyboard.  

* ms sculpt for ergo
* wanting mechanical and ergo
* ready made are pricy
* discovering /r/ergomechkeyboards
* wanting lower cost introduction just in case it's not for me

# Learning about the build process

## How to build a keyboard?

## learning about soldering

# Sourcing the bits and pieces
