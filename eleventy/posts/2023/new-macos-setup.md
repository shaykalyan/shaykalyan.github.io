New Mac, hu dis? ðŸ˜‰
---

Since leaving the Microsoft world behind and the new gig handing me a MacBook, I've decided to switch my personal computing to MacOS as well by grabbing a MacBook Pro to replace both of my aging desktop and laptop devices. This page is the set of tweaks, apps, and configuration I've employed to make that transition as easy as possible. 

If you have any tips or tricks of your own, or suggestions for things I've missed, hit me up on Threads: <a href="//threads.net/@shaykalyan">@shaykalyan</a>!

## The hardware
14" Macbook Pro with the baseline M2 Pro, 32GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD for storage. I also grabbed a [Caldigit TS3 Plus](https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/) dock to plug in my monitors and peripherals, and now it's an easy swap of a USB-C between my work laptop and my personal.

## The Apps
* [Rectangle app](https://rectangleapp.com/): window snapping/tiling. A pro tip is here to set up shortcuts similar to Windows, e.g., `CTRL + âŒ˜ + <arrow key>` for left, right, maximizing of windows. 
* [TextPal](https://www.textpal.app/):  emojis at your fingertips with autocomplete prompting with a shortcut of your choosing, e.g., `\<start typing>`.
* [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/): powered-up screencaps! The built-in screen capture support is fine, but this lets you perform markup and other edits easily, and have it all go straight to your clipboardâ€” zero faff.
* [Kap](https://getkap.co/): easy video capture and processing out to gifs.
* [Maccy](https://maccy.app/): clipboard manager. There are a few options out there, but this to me has the least intrusive UX. It also has support for non-text content and pinned (permanent) items. 
* [Flow](https://flowapp.info/): a simple and effective menu-bar based pomodoro timer.
* [Hidden Bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden#-install): simple app to hide the overflow of icons along the menu bar. If you need more control, there's also the paid [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) app.
* [Aerial](https://aerialscreensaver.github.io/): beautiful screensavers like what you'd get on Apple TV. Though the latest MacOS Sonoma is meant to bring some of that soon! 
* [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) is a battery charge limiter app that lets you set a charge limit, e.g., 70%, after which the laptop will use the power supply. I find it especially important for my case where I'll primarily be using it docked at home and want to maintain my battery's health for as long as possible. MacOS does have an option to limit the charge at 80%, but it only goes into effect after it "learns" from your usage, and for some people, that never ends up working! There's enough discourse online around whether apps like this one is necessary, and from what I've read, it seems to work as advertised for keeping battery cycles low and overall health high, e.g., [Reddit discussion one](https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/rv1fv1/aldente_what_are_your_experiences_with_it/) and [Reddit discussion two](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/14509gk/thoughts_on_aldente_pro/).


## System Settings 
Lots of out of the box defaults that don't jive with me. 

### General
* Sharing > Make sure all sharing is disabled and update computer name

### Appearance
* Show scroll bars: `Always`

### Control Center
* Battery > Show Percentage: `Enable`

### Display and Dock
* Automatically hide and shock Dock: `Enable`
* Default web browser: `<pick one>` 
* Show recent applications in dock: `Disable`

### Keyboard
* Keyboard navigation: `Enable`
* Keyboard Shortcuts > App Shortcuts > All Applications > type in `Emoji & Symbols` and pick you shortcut, e.g., `âŒ˜ + .` to pop up the emoji panel!
* Input Sources > Edit > Capitalize words automatically: `Disable`
* Input Sources > Edit > Add period with double-space: `Disable`
* Input Sources > Edit > Use smart quotes and dashes: `Disable`
* Input Sources > Edit > Use `"` for double quotes
* Input Sources > Edit > Use `'` for single quotes

### Trackpad
* Secondary click: `Click or Tap with two fingers`
* Tap to click: `Enable`
* More Gestures > App ExposÃ©: `Swipe down with Three Fingers`
* More Gestures > Launchpad: `Disable`

## Finder Settings
Some minor tweaks here: 
* General > set home directory as default
* Tags > disable these to remove the clutter

As for moving around the directories, these shortcuts are handy to know: 
* `âŒ˜ + Shift + G`: Navigate to a path
* `âŒ˜ + Option + C`: Copy an item's path to clipboard
* You can also hold the `Option` key while looking at the context menu ("right click") of an item in Finder to reveal alternative selections, including having the `Copy` option become `Copy <item> as Pathname`
